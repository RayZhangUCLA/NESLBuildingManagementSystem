# NESLBuilingManagementSystem

This is my undergraduate research project in NESL lab. It is a building management system that is supposed to have three parts: sensor data collections, data visualizations, and data analysis. 

For data collection, it can be achieved by an embedded computer extracting readings from different types of sensors in a room and uploading them to our lab servers. It can also be achieved through third party platforms directly sending data to our lab servers. In practice, we have a Beaglebone Black reading data from smart power panel, Netatmo Weather Station, RFduino. We also have motion sensor readings from Smartthings servers.
